description: "> The ESP-IDF 2nd stage Bootloader implements functions related to the\
  \ Secure Boot feature. In previous releases of ESP-IDF releases (2.x, 3.0.5, 3.1),\
  \ the 2nd stage Bootloader did not sufficiently verify the load address of binary\
  \ image sections. If the Secure Boot feature was used without the Flash Encryption\
  \ feature enabled, an attacker could craft a binary which would overwrite parts\
  \ of the 2nd stage Bootloader\u2019s code whilst the binary file is being loaded.\
  \ Such a binary could be used to execute arbitrary code, thus bypassing the Secure\
  \ Boot check."
