    "The states $x_i$ of the LCG are related by the formula \n",

    "\n",
    "So it makes sense to define $w_i', y_i'$ and $z_i'$ by $2^{l-\\text{trunc}}w_i' + 2^{\\text{trunc}}y_i' + z_i' = x_i'$.\n",

    "### Breaking the Truncated LCG: Predicting Future Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "We have now recovered the differences between consecutive states of the LCG! The next step is to predict future outputs. It's unlikely we'll be able to recover $c$ directly since we only have the differences and not the actual states themselves. Fortunately, there's an easy way to predict the next output even without knowing $c$. The main thing to notice is that we aren't really interested in $x_{k+1}$; we don't need to recover the _full_ state, all we care about is the next output, which can be determined from $w_k$ and $z_k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have $x_{k-1}', w_k$ and $z_k$, and we want to find $w_{k+1}$ and $z_{k+1}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "By construction, we have $x_k' = x_{k+1} - x_k$ and $x_k' \\equiv ax_{k-1}' \\pmod M$. And we concluded from this that $ax_{k-1}' \\mod M = x_{k+1} - x_k$. This conclusion isn't neccessarily true. For example, see what happens when $x_{k+1} - x_k$ is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can't determine $x_{k+1}$ and $x_k$ fully, we can't know whether $x_{k+1} - x_k$ is positive or negative. This means we may potentially get the wrong output. Luckily, the game lets us guess 5 numbers, and it turns out that this is enough for us to win every time.\n",
    "\n",
