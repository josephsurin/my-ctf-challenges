The given ciphertext is

```
Ypw'zj zwufpp hwu txadjkcq dtbtyu kqkwxrbvu! Mbz cjzg kv IAJBO{ndldie_al_aqk_jjrnsxee}. Xzi utj gnn olkd qgq ftk ykaqe uei mbz ocrt qi ynlu, etrm mff'n wij bf wlny mjcj :).
```

The title hints at the well known [Caesar Shift Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). If we try to ROT13 or use substitution cipher solvers on the ciphertext, we don't get any useful results. There are a couple things that we can observe to help us proceed. The first is that the title is called "rot-i". This hints at each element being rotated by a different amount. Punctuation has also been preserved, so we can use this to guess what the plaintext might be. Specifically, the first word looks like it might say "You're" or "You've", and indeed if we look a bit closer, `Y = Y + 0`, `p = o + 1`, `w = u + 2`, and so on... It looks like each letter is shifted by `i` positions, where `i` is its index in the message.

**Solve script:**

```python
from string import ascii_lowercase, ascii_uppercase

c = "Ypw'zj zwufpp hwu txadjkcq dtbtyu kqkwxrbvu! Mbz cjzg kv IAJBO{ndldie_al_aqk_jjrnsxee}. Xzi utj gnn olkd qgq ftk ykaqe uei mbz ocrt qi ynlu, etrm mff'n wij bf wlny mjcj :)."

def decrypt(ct):
    out = ''
    for i,c in enumerate(ct):
        if c in ascii_lowercase:
            alph = ascii_lowercase
        elif c in ascii_uppercase:
            alph = ascii_uppercase
        else:
            out += c
            continue
        out += alph[(alph.index(c) - i) % len(alph)]
    return out

print(decrypt(c))
```

Which gives:

> You've solved the beginner crypto challenge! The flag is DUCTF{crypto_is_fun_kjqlptzy}. Now get out some pen and paper for the rest of them, they won't all be this easy :).

### Alternative Solution (no scripting)

The challenge can also be solved using only online tools, or just pen and paper. We can notice a part in the ciphertext that looks similar to the flag format `DUCTF{...}`. We can ignore the rest of the ciphertext and try rotating this to reduce the work. Notice that `D` has been shifted `5` letters up to turn into `I`. `U` has been shifted `6` letters up (and wrapped around the alphabet) to get to `A`. `C` has been shifted `7` letters up to get to `J`, and so on. Shifting in the opposite direction reveals the flag.
