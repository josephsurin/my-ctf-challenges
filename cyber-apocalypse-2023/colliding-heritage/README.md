> As you arrive at the location of the relic, you discover an ancient tomb that appears to have no visible entrance. However, a scan of the area reveals the presence of unusual RF signals coming from a specific location. With the help of your team, you manage to create an interface to communicate with the signal-emitting device. Unfortunately, the device only grants access to descendants of the pharaoh’s left hand. Can you find a way to enter the tomb?
